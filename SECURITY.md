# Security Documentation

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the IIT Delhi OAE Flutter application to protect sensitive data and ensure secure operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### 1. Firebase Configuration Security

#### Sensitive Files Excluded from Git
The following files contain sensitive information and are automatically excluded from version control:

- `android/app/google-services.json` - Firebase Android configuration
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Firebase iOS configuration  
- `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Firebase macOS configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Firebase project configuration
- `.env` files - Environment variables

#### Configuration Placeholders
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` contains placeholder values instead of actual API keys
- `firebase.json` uses placeholder project IDs and app IDs
- Developers must replace placeholders with actual values for local development

### 2. Authentication Security

#### Firebase Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- Secure token-based sessions
- Automatic token refresh
- Sign-out functionality to clear local data

#### User Role Management
- Role-based access control (Student, Driver, Admin)
- Permission validation on all operations
- Session management with automatic timeout

### 3. Data Security

#### Firestore Security Rules
- User-specific data access
- Role-based permissions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Real-time security rule enforcement

#### Local Storage Security
- Secure storage for sensitive user data
- Encrypted preferences storage
- Automatic data cleanup on logout

### 4. Network Security

#### HTTPS Enforcement
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Certificate pinning for mobile apps
- Secure WebSocket connections

#### API Security
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Error handling without sensitive data exposure

## üîê Best Practices for Developers

### 1. Never Commit Sensitive Data
```bash
# ‚ùå DON'T commit these files
google-services.json
GoogleService-Info.plist
.env
*.key
*.pem

# ‚úÖ DO use placeholders
YOUR_API_KEY
YOUR_PROJECT_ID
YOUR_APP_ID
```

### 2. Environment Variables
For additional security, use environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file (not tracked by git)
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### 3. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication checks in place

### 4. Testing Security
```bash
# Run security checks
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If You Accidentally Commit Sensitive Data

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove the file from git history
   - Revoke and regenerate API keys
   - Update Firebase project settings

2. **Git History Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/sensitive/file' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

3. **Force Push**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO** contact the development team privately
3. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** wait for acknowledgment before public disclosure

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All API keys are in environment variables
- [ ] Firebase rules are properly configured
- [ ] Authentication is working correctly
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive data

### Regular Security Audits
- [ ] Review Firebase security rules monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor for security advisories
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Test authentication flows

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Firebase Security Features
- Authentication logs
- Firestore access logs
- Storage access logs
- Real-time security alerts

### Application Monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User activity logs
- Security event logging
